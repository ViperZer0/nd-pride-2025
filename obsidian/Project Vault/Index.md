## Structure and Content
This vault is divided into key folders, each of which should contain artifacts with a specific purpose:
- **Architecture**: Should contain documentation about specific tangible game components and write-ups about game-level systems.
- **Convention**: Contains guidelines for handling game artifacts.
- **Design**: Should contain high-level design documents that may or may not relate to specific in-game components.

Generally, ideas are explored in Design documents and are eventually translated into game components and described in new documents in the Architecture section.
## External Links
This section should contain links to relevant external resources, such as code repositories, Trello boards, etc.
